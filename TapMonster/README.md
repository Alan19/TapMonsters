Work distribution for Each Group Member:


Sam: 
  -Worked in all classes under the Rewards package, and coded the methods to select and implement a random reward upon defeating a boss, as well as the unique rewards
  -For working with ArrayLists, I used two: one called listOfRewards for storing the rewards the player had gotten, and one called rewardPool for holding the rewards it was possible to acquire, which were added to it when the screen initialized and removed if the reward was unique.
  -Some examples of logic in my code include the methods in TapMonsterScreen that adds the rewards from Reward to RewardPool, and the method to insure that unique rewards do not pop up again
  -I created the RewardTarget interface that was implemented by Javiy into TapMonsterScreen
  -My game concept was previously submitted
  -I was on the back end subteam, although I collaborated with Javiy and Ahmed extensively on incorporating currency and rewards into the game respectively
